AirMoneyB is a web application that uses machine learning to predict the best price for a property manage use on AirBnB. This was a team project, and most of my contributions lay in the front end: creating the look and interaction of the website, and deploying the application online. Give it a try and enter in any address to see what the best daily rate would be on AirBnB.
