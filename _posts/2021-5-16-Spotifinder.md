Spotifinder is a web application that uses natural language processing to recommend a song based on similarity of lyrics from your chosen song. 
This was a team project, and my role was in creating the model. Give it a try and pick an artist and song from the dropdown menu. 
Please note the site is currently under construction, so there are only 3 artists and songs to choose from right now. 
Please choose the artist and the correlating song by number. It will be improved soon!
