Spotifinder is a web application that uses Natural Language Processing to recommend a song based on similarity of lyrics from your chosen song. 
This was a team project, and my role was in creating the model and the front end using Plotly Dash. Give it a try and pick an artist and song from the dropdown menu (you can also type in your selection).
