title: About me
---

I'm a Data Scientist from Lambda School (graduated 2021), specializing in Machine Learning and Data Engineering. 

Before then, I was a film editor for 9 years in Austin, Taipei, and New York City (including one year-long stint as a TV show host). For the past 9 years, I've been a proud stay-at-home parent to two kids (and one doggie) in Orange County, CA. 

My hobbies all involve using my hands: sewing, knitting, baking, woodworking, and house repair. I love making things! That includes movies edited on a computer, or products created by code. My favorite workday includes collaborating with teammates and working closely with stakeholders.
