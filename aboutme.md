title: About me
---

I'm a Data Scientist from Lambda School (graduated 2021), specializing in Machine Learning and Data Engineering. 

Before then, I was a film editor for 9 years in Austin, Taipei, and New York City, including one year-long stint as a TV show host (Fun Fact!). For the past 9 years, I've been a proud stay-at-home parent to two kids (and one doggie) in Orange County, CA. 

I love making things! My hobbies involve using my hands: sewing, knitting, baking, woodworking, and house repair. It's the same joy I find in my work, whether it's editing movies on a computer, or creating a machine learning model with code.
