I've been a stay at home parent since 2012 for two squirrely kids, in Orange County, California. 
Before then, I was a video editor in NYC. 
Before then, I did various roles of film and tv post production (including a year long stint as a TV host) in Taipei, Taiwan.
Before then, I was really into theatre performing, and appreciating BBQ in Texas, where I was born and raised.

Now I'm switching careers into Data Science! I'm sure that's what I'll remember first when I think of the year 2020.
