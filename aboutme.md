title: About me
---

I've been a stay at home parent since 2012 for two squirrely kids, in Orange County, California. 

Before then, I was a video editor in NYC. 

Before then, I did various roles of film and tv post production (including a year long stint as a TV host) in Taipei, Taiwan.

Now I'm switching careers into Data Science! I'm currently attending Lambda School.
